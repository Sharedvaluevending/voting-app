Git was not found. Do one of the following:

OPTION 1 - Install Git (recommended)
------------------------------------
1. Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer.
3. On "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose:
   "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
4. Finish the install, then double-click commit-and-push.bat again.


OPTION 2 - Use Git from a custom location
-----------------------------------------
If Git is already installed but in a different folder:

1. Find git.exe on your PC (e.g. search for "git.exe" in File Explorer).
2. In this folder (voting-app), create a text file named:  git-path.txt
3. Put one line in it: the full path to git.exe
   Example:  C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe
   Or:       D:\Tools\Git\bin\git.exe
4. Save the file, then double-click commit-and-push.bat again.
