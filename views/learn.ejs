    <h3>Timeframes (5 levels)</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:12px;">The engine analyzes candles across 5 timeframes to find confluence.</p>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>15m</strong> — Scalping setups, fast entries. 96 candles (24 hours of data).</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>1H</strong> — Core analysis timeframe (25% weight). 168 candles (7 days).</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>4H</strong> — Intermediate trend and structure (35% weight). 100 candles (~17 days).</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>1D</strong> — Daily trend, dominant weight (40%). 30 candles (1 month).</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>1W</strong> — Weekly macro trend for Position strategy. 26 candles (~6 months).</div>
    <div class="journal-entry" style="color:#6b7280;"><strong>Confluence</strong> — When 2/3 or 3/3 of the core timeframes (1H/4H/1D) agree on direction, the signal gets a confidence bonus. 3/3 = strong, 1/3 = weak.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Key Indicators</h3>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</strong><br>Measures momentum. Below 30 = oversold (potential buy). Above 70 = overbought (potential sell). 14-period standard.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>RSI Divergence</strong><br>When price makes a lower low but RSI makes a higher low = bullish divergence (potential bottom). When price makes a higher high but RSI makes a lower high = bearish divergence (potential top). Weighted in scoring to reduce shorts at bottoms and longs at tops.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>MACD</strong><br>Shows trend momentum. When MACD crosses above signal line = bullish. Histogram shows strength of the cross.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>MACD Divergence</strong><br>Price lower low + MACD histogram higher low = bullish. Price higher high + MACD histogram lower high = bearish. Used with RSI divergence to identify reversal zones.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>OBV (On-Balance Volume) Divergence</strong><br>Price lower low + OBV higher low = bullish (volume accumulating despite price drop). Price higher high + OBV lower high = bearish (volume distributing despite price rise). Volume often leads price.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Stochastic Divergence</strong><br>Same pattern as RSI: price lower low + Stoch higher low = bullish. Price higher high + Stoch lower high = bearish. 2+ divergence types agreeing = stronger reversal signal.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>ADX</strong><br>Measures trend strength (not direction). Above 25 = trending. Above 40 = strong trend. Below 20 = no trend.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>VWAP</strong><br>Volume Weighted Average Price. Institutions use this. Price above VWAP = bullish bias. Below = bearish.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong><br>Shows volatility. Price near lower band in uptrend = buy zone. Squeeze (narrow bands) = big move coming.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Stochastic</strong><br>Like RSI but compares price to range. K/D crossover in oversold = buy signal. In overbought = sell signal.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>ATR (Average True Range)</strong><br>Measures volatility in price terms. Used to set stop losses and position sizes. Higher ATR = wider stops needed.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Market Structure</strong><br>HH/HL = bullish (higher highs + higher lows). LH/LL = bearish. Break of structure = potential reversal.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Top &amp; Bottom Detection</strong><br>Potential bottom: bullish divergence + oversold RSI or near support. Potential top: bearish divergence + overbought RSI or near resistance. The engine penalizes shorts at potential bottoms and longs at potential tops to avoid getting trapped.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>EMA (9/21)</strong><br>Fast/slow exponential moving averages. When 9 EMA crosses above 21 = bullish crossover. Price above both = uptrend.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>SMA (20/50)</strong><br>Simple moving averages. 20 above 50 = bullish alignment. Price below both = downtrend.</div>
  </div>

    <h3>Risk Management Rules</h3>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>1. Never risk more than 2% per trade</strong><br>If your account is $10,000, max risk per trade = $200.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>2. Always use a stop loss</strong><br>No exceptions. The system calculates stops using ATR + structure.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>3. Risk/Reward minimum 1.5:1</strong><br>Your potential profit should be at least 1.5x your risk.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>4. Leverage matches confidence</strong><br>Only use higher leverage when the score is 70+. High vol = low leverage.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>5. 1 trade per pair</strong><br>Don't stack positions. Wait for your trade to close before opening another on the same pair.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>6. Follow the system</strong><br>Journal shows you win more when you follow rules. Trust the process.</div>

    <h3>Quant-Desk Upgrades (v4)</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:12px;">21 upgrades for better signals and fewer losing trades.</p>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Signals &amp; scoring</strong><br>1. Learned strategy weights used in scoring. 2. Min score (52) and confluence (2) gate – weak setups show HOLD. 3. BTC regime filter – no alt longs when BTC STRONG_SELL, no alt shorts when BTC STRONG_BUY. 4. MTF divergence penalty when 1H and 4H disagree. 5. RSI, MACD, OBV &amp; Stochastic divergence – weighted toward bottoms/tops; bullish div boosts longs, bearish boosts shorts; 2+ types agreeing = stronger modifier; penalizes counter-trend at extremes. 6. Top/bottom detection – penalizes shorts at potential bottoms and longs at potential tops. 7. Session filter – small score reduction outside 12–22 UTC. 8. Regime–strategy gating – e.g. no Mean Reversion in trending. 9. Min 5 trades per strategy before it can be selected.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Levels &amp; risk</strong><br>8. Dynamic ATR stops by regime (tighter in trending, wider in volatile). 9. Multi-timeframe S/R (1D/4H used for stops when available). 10. VWAP bands – bonus when price is in value zone (within 0.5 ATR of VWAP). 11. <strong>Fibonacci retracement</strong> – stops refined using 0.618 and key fib levels. 12. <strong>Volume Profile/POC</strong> – point of control adds S/R confluence.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Execution &amp; position</strong><br>13. Trade buttons only when score ≥55 and confluence ≥2. 12. <strong>Entry at live price</strong> – entry uses current market price when you open. 13. <strong>Multi-strategy trades</strong> – on each coin’s detail page you can open a trade using the main signal or any top strategy (Scalping, Momentum, Breakout, etc.) that scores ≥55; each strategy has its own stop and take-profit levels (scalping = tighter, swing/position = wider). 14. Trailing stop – stop moves to breakeven after 1R profit. 15. Slippage simulation (0.05%) on entry and exit. 16. Confidence-weighted position size (higher score = slightly larger size, cap 1.2×). 17. Slippage simulation (0.05%). 18. <strong>Streak-aware + Kelly sizing</strong> – position size adjusts for win/loss streaks and uses fractional Kelly criterion. 19. Cooldown – 4h same-direction re-entry block.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Data &amp; learning</strong><br>20. Strategy weights from AI Engine feed into scoring. 21. Expectancy drives strategy selection. 18. Quality gate and session messages appear in “Why This Trade” when relevant. 23. <strong>Faster weight learning</strong> for strategies. 24. <strong>Funding rate</strong> contrarian signals. 25. <strong>BTC correlation</strong> scoring.</div>
    <div class="journal-entry"><strong>Order blocks, FVG and liquidity clusters</strong><br>19. Order blocks – last opposing candle before a strong move (bullish OB = support, bearish OB = resistance); structure bonus when price is near a valid OB. 20. Fair value gaps (FVG) – 3-candle imbalances; price in or near a FVG zone adds confluence. 21. Liquidity clusters – swing highs/lows grouped by proximity; near a cluster adds structure context and appears in reasoning.</div>

    <h3>v5 Upgrades — Institutional Edge</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:12px;">7 new features for smarter entries, better risk management, and data-driven sizing.</p>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>1. Funding Rate Contrarian Signal</strong><br>
      Fetched from Binance Futures every 60 seconds for all tracked coins. Extreme positive funding (&gt;0.1%) means the market is overleveraged long — bearish contrarian signal. Extreme negative (&lt;-0.1%) means overleveraged short — bullish contrarian. The score penalizes trades going with the crowd and rewards contrarian positions. During trade monitoring, funding rate warnings appear in the score check.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>2. BTC Correlation Score</strong><br>
      Calculates Pearson correlation between each alt's hourly returns and BTC's returns. When correlation is high (&gt;0.7) and BTC's direction disagrees with the alt's signal, the score is penalized. This prevents entering alt trades that are likely to be overridden by BTC's movement. During monitoring, a "High BTC correlation — watch BTC" message appears for correlated pairs.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>3. Volume Profile / Point of Control (POC)</strong><br>
      Calculates the price level with the highest traded volume across the last 100+ candles. The POC acts as a strong support/resistance level — price tends to gravitate back to it. When price is within 0.5% of POC, the score gets a bonus (+3). POC is also used as additional S/R when calculating stop loss and take profit levels.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>4. Fibonacci Retracement Levels</strong><br>
      Calculates key Fibonacci levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%) from the 4H swing high/low. These levels refine stop loss placement — if a strong fib level (especially 0.618, the golden ratio) sits between your entry and calculated stop, the stop is tightened to just below/above that fib level. Fibonacci levels also provide additional S/R for trade level calculations.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>5. Win/Loss Streak Awareness</strong><br>
      The system tracks your consecutive wins and losses. After a losing streak:<br>
      &bull; 2 consecutive losses: position size reduced by 25%<br>
      &bull; 3+ consecutive losses: position size reduced by 40%<br>
      After a winning streak (3+ wins): position size boosted up to 15%. This protects capital during drawdowns and lets you lean in when you're on a roll.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>6. Adaptive Position Sizing (Kelly Criterion)</strong><br>
      Uses the fractional Kelly criterion (25% of full Kelly) based on each strategy's win rate and average risk/reward ratio from the learning engine:<br>
      <strong>Kelly% = WinRate - (1 - WinRate) / AvgRR</strong><br>
      If Kelly is positive, position size is capped to 25% of Kelly × balance. If Kelly is negative (strategy is losing money), position size is reduced by 50%. This ensures profitable strategies get more capital while unprofitable ones are de-risked automatically. Requires at least 15 trades of data.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>7. Stricter Regime-Strategy Gating</strong><br>
      Strategies are now more aggressively blocked in wrong market conditions:<br>
      &bull; Mean Reversion: blocked in trending AND compression (only allowed in ranging/mixed/volatile)<br>
      &bull; Trend Following: blocked in ranging AND volatile<br>
      &bull; Breakout: blocked in trending (needs consolidation first)<br>
      &bull; Swing: blocked in volatile (gets stopped out)<br>
      &bull; Position: blocked in volatile AND compression<br>
      This reduces false signals from strategies being used in the wrong market regime.

    <h3>Trade Actions &amp; Auto-Management</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:12px;">The platform automatically monitors your open trades and can take actions to protect profit and manage risk. Actions appear as colored badges on your trade cards and chart page.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>How Auto-Actions Work</strong><br>
      Two systems run in the background:<br><br>
      <strong>1. Stop Management (every 60 seconds)</strong><br>
      &bull; <strong>Breakeven (BE)</strong> – When price moves 1R in your favor (1R = distance from entry to your original stop loss), your stop automatically moves to your entry price. Zero risk from this point.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Trailing Stop (TS)</strong> – At 1.5R profit, the stop begins trailing 1R behind the best price. As price makes new highs (longs) or new lows (shorts), the stop follows, locking in gains.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Stepped Lock-in</strong> – If trailing is off, stops lock at 0.5R, 0.75R, and 1R as the trade progresses 50%, 75%, 90% toward TP2.<br>
      These are controlled by "Auto move to breakeven" and "Auto trailing stop" in your <a href="/performance" style="color:#3b82f6;">Settings</a>.<br><br>
      <strong>2. Score Check Actions (every 5 minutes)</strong><br>
      The engine re-analyzes the market and compares the current score to your entry score. Based on how the score has shifted:<br>
      &bull; <strong>Hold</strong> – Score moved 20+ in your favor. Thesis is strong, hold.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Tighten stop</strong> – Score dipped slightly (-5) or heat is yellow. Moves stop to breakeven.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Lock in profit</strong> – 50%+ progress toward TP2. Steps stop to lock 0.5R/0.75R/1R.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Take partial (PP)</strong> – Near TP1 and signals weakening. Closes 1/3 of position.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Reduce position (RP)</strong> – Score dropped -15+ against the trade. Closes 50%.<br>
      &bull; <strong>Consider exit (EXIT)</strong> – Red heat + danger + score -25+ against. Closes entire position.<br><br>
      Score check actions only auto-execute if "Auto-execute score check actions" is enabled in <a href="/performance" style="color:#3b82f6;">Settings</a>. Otherwise they appear as suggestions only.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>Leverage-Aware Thresholds</strong><br>
      At 3x+ leverage, the system uses tighter thresholds because losses are amplified:<br>
      &bull; Exit threshold: -20 (vs -25 at 1x)<br>
      &bull; Reduce threshold: -10 (vs -15 at 1x)<br>
      &bull; Yellow heat + score slipping at 3x+ = automatic "Reduce position" suggestion.<br>
      &bull; Trades open 48+ hours with less than 1% price movement get a "Trade stale" warning.
    </div>

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>Progress Indicator</strong><br>
      Each trade card shows how close the trade is to triggering the next action:<br>
      &bull; "BE at 1R: 45%" – Trade is 45% of the way to breakeven trigger.<br>
      &bull; "Stop at breakeven" – BE already triggered, showing progress to trailing (1.5R).<br>
      &bull; "Trailing active" – Stop is actively following the price.<br>
      &bull; "(underwater)" – Trade is in the red, no auto-action will fire yet.

    <div class="journal-entry">
      <strong>How Candlestick Patterns Integrate</strong><br>
      The engine scans every timeframe (15m through 1W) for 24+ candlestick patterns.
      Each detected pattern receives a <strong>context-weighted score</strong> that feeds into the Structure (+5 max) and Momentum (+3 max) sub-scores.<br><br>
      <strong>Bullish patterns</strong> (green) add <span style="color:#10b981;font-weight:600;">bullPoints</span> &rarr; support <strong>LONG</strong> signals.<br>
      <strong>Bearish patterns</strong> (red) add <span style="color:#ef4444;font-weight:600;">bearPoints</span> &rarr; support <strong>SHORT</strong> signals.<br><br>
      A pattern alone is a weak signal. A pattern <em>at the right place</em> with confirming indicators is powerful.
      The system multiplies pattern weight based on context:<br>
      &bull; At support/resistance: <strong>1.5x</strong><br>
      &bull; With RSI divergence: <strong>1.3x</strong><br>
      &bull; High volume confirmation: <strong>1.3x</strong><br>
      &bull; At order block: <strong>1.3x</strong><br>
      &bull; In BB squeeze: <strong>1.2x</strong><br>
      &bull; Higher TF trend aligned: <strong>1.2x</strong><br>
      &bull; Against higher TF trend: <strong>0.6x</strong> (reduced)<br>
      &bull; Against S/R level: <strong>0.6x</strong> (reduced)

          <strong style="color:#10b981;">LONG Example:</strong><br>
          <span style="font-size:12px;color:#9ca3af;">Bullish Engulfing at 4H support + RSI divergence + volume spike = pattern weight boosted 1.5x × 1.3x × 1.3x → strong structure/momentum bonus → higher score → stronger BUY signal.</span>

          <span style="font-size:12px;color:#9ca3af;">Evening Star at 1D resistance + RSI overbought + bearish OB nearby = pattern weight boosted significantly → higher bearPoints → stronger SELL signal for shorts.</span>

          <span style="font-size:12px;color:#9ca3af;">Bullish Engulfing on 1H but against the 1D downtrend + at resistance = pattern weight cut to 0.6x × 0.6x → minimal impact. The system prevents false signals.</span>
